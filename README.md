# Task-Manager
I developed a task manager web application using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The application features user authentication, where users are required to have a valid token in order to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their tasks. The app provides functionality for adding, updating, deleting, and fetching all tasks for the authenticated user.
